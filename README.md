# Noisy Surface Code Simulations

This repository investigates the effect of physically motivated stochastic gate noise on quantum error correction using surface codes. It includes implementations in both Qiskit and QuTiP, and extends a noisy gates framework to support realistic quantum circuit behavior. The work is based on simulations of 4-qubit and 9-qubit planar surface codes, with a focus on benchmarking fidelity and understanding decoherence impacts.
